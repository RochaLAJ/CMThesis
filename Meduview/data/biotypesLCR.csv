"","Biotypes","Freq","Percentage","Description"
"1","lncRNA",133," 1.45%","A non-coding RNA generally longer than 200 nucleotides that cannot be classified as any other ncRNA subtype. Similar to mRNAs, lncRNAs are mainly transcribed by RNA polymerase II, are often capped by 7-methyl guanosine at their 5' ends, polyadenylated at their 3' ends and may be spliced."
"2","Mt_rRNA",1," 0.01%","Mitochondrial rRNA is an RNA component of the small or large subunits of mitochondrial ribosomes."
"3","polymorphic_pseudogene",2," 0.02%","A pseudogene in the reference genome, though known to be intact in the genomes of other individuals of the same species. The annotation process has confirmed that the pseudogenisation event is not a genomic sequencing error."
"4","processed_pseudogene",119," 1.29%","A pseudogene created via retrotranposition of the mRNA of a functional protein-coding parent gene followed by accumulation of deleterious mutations lacking introns and promoters, often including a polyA tail."
"5","protein_coding",8767,"95.40%","A gene which, when transcribed, can be translated into a protein."
"6","scaRNA",5," 0.05%","A ncRNA, specific to the Cajal body, that has been demonstrated to function as a guide RNA in the site-specific synthesis of 2'-O-ribose-methylated nucleotides and pseudouridines in the RNA polymerase II-transcribed U1, U2, U4 and U5 spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs)."
"7","snoRNA",38," 0.41%","Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs enriched in the nucleolus as components of small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins. They guide ribose methylation and pseudouridylation of rRNAs and snRNAs, and a subgroup regulate excision of rRNAs from rRNA precursor transcripts. snoRNAs may also guide rRNA acetylation and tRNA methylation, and regulate mRNA abundance and alternative splicing."
"8","TEC",2," 0.02%","To Be Experimentally Confirmed â€“ This is used for non-spliced EST clusters that have polyA features. This category has been specifically created for the ENCODE project to highlight regions that could indicate the presence of protein coding genes that require experimental validation, either by 5' RACE or RT-PCR to extend the transcripts, or by confirming expression of the putatively-encoded peptide with specific antibodies."
"9","transcribed_processed_pseudogene",13," 0.14%","A processed_pseudogene overlapped by locus-specific evidence of transcription."
"10","transcribed_unitary_pseudogene",10," 0.11%","A species specific unprocessed pseudogene without a parent gene, as it has an active orthologue in another species."
"11","transcribed_unprocessed_pseudogene",81," 0.88%","A unprocessed pseudogene supported by locus-specific evidence of transcription."
"12","unprocessed_pseudogene",17," 0.18%","A pseudogene that arose from a means other than retrotransposition. A pseudogene created via genomic duplication of a functional protein-coding parent gene followed by accumulation of deleterious mutations."
